Dear Ms. McBvoy:
I am writing to inf'orm you that the Centers for Medicare &Medicaid Services (CMS) is granting Connecticut
final approval of its Statewide Transition Plan (STP) to bring settings into compliance with the f'edefal home
and community-based services (FICBS) regulations found at 42 CFR Section aa1.301(c)(aX5) and Section
aal.710(a)(l)(2). Upon receiving initial approval for conrpletion of its systemic assessmeÌìt and outline of
systemic remediation activities on October 21, 2016,fhe state worked diligentìy in making a series of technical
changes requested by CMS in order to achieve frnal approval.
Final approval is granted to the state after completing the following activities: . Conducted a comprehensive site-specific assessment and validation ofall settings set'ving individuals
receiving Medicaid-funded HCBS, and included in the STP the outcomes of these activities and
proposed remediation strategies to rectify any issues uncovered through the site specific assessurent and
validation processes by the end of the transition period'
o Outlined a detailed plan for identifying settings that are presumed to have institutional characteÍistics,
including qualities that isolate HCBS beneficiaries, as well as the proposed pl'ocess for evaluating these
settings and preparing for submission to CMS 1'or review under heightened scrutiny;
o Developed a process for communicating with beneficiaries who are currently receiving services in
settings that the state has determined cannot or will not come into compliance with the home and
community-based settings criteria by March 17, 2022; and
¡ Established ongoing monitoring and quality assurance processes that will ensure all settings providing
HCBS continue to remain fully compliant with the rule in the future'
After reviewing the STP submitted by the state on June 21,2019, CMS provided additional fèedback on July 3,
2019 and July 16, 2019 and requested technical changes be made to the STP in order for the state to receive
frnal approval. These changes did not necessitate another public comment period. The state subsequently
addressed all issues and resubmitted an updated version on July 18,2019, A summary ofthe technical changes
made by the state is atlached.
The state is encouraged to work collaboratively with CMS to identify any areas that may need strengtheuing
with respect to the state's remediation and heightened scrutiny processes as the state implernents each ofthese
key elements of the transition plan. Optional quarterly reports through the milestone tracking systern, designed
to assist states to track their transition processes, will focus on four key areas:
1. Reviewing progress made to-date in the state's completion of its proposed milestones;
2. Discussing challenges and potential strategies for addressing issues that may arise during the state's
remediation processes;
3. Adjusting the state's process as needed to assure that all sites meeting the regulation's categories of
presumed institutional settingsl have been identified, reflects how the state has assessed settings based
on each of the three categories and the state's progress in preparing submissions to CMS for a
heightened scrutiny review; and
4. Providing feedback to CMS on the status of implementation, including noting any challenges with
respect to capacity building efforts and technical support needs.
It is important to note that CMS' approval of a STP solely addresses the state's compliance with the applicable
Medicaid authorities. CMS' approval does not address the state's independent and separate obligations under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or the Supreme Cotttl's Olmstead v.
IC decision. Guidance from the Depaftment of Justice concerning compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act and the Olmstead decision is available at

distinct from the final STP approval.
Thank you for your work on this STP. CMS appreciates the state's effort in completing this work and

Dear Director
2019 Funding and Requirements
The Department will be providing core funding of up to €50,000 to each local 
authority in 2019 towards the cost of its PPN, provided this is supplemented by a 
minimum of €30,000 from the authority’s own resources.
An initial payment of €30,000 from the Department’s commitment will be made to 
each local authority, subject to compliance with certain conditions outlined below, 
to ensure PPNs have access to funding as early as possible. The Department requests 
that your authority’s contribution would be made available from the outset in 2019 
to the PPN so as to maximise the total budget available to the PPN. 
The Department’s contribution in 2019 will be subject to two conditions, the first is 
the receipt of written confirmation from each local authority that a clear 
Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the local authority and 
PPN in respect of 2019. In this regard, the MOU should outline in a clear and 
unambiguous manner the roles and responsibilities of the local authority and PPN 
with regard to the delivery of the PPN Programme during the year including, as far 
as practical, an indication of how agreed funding in 2019 is intended to be spent.
In agreeing the MOU, Local Authorities and PPNs are asked to consider the 
recommendations in the 2017 PPN Annual Report and in particular those around 
supports, value and recognition of the role of PPNs

The Department has allocated €25,700 to each PPN for this purpose which is 
intended to cover the salary and associated costs of employment of a Support Worker. 
As advised, this additional funding was to be paid in two instalments - €22,500 of 
which was paid in December 2018, with the balance of the Departments contribution 
- €3,200 - to be paid in early 2019, at the same time as payment of the first tranche 
of 2019 funding. If not already done so, the funding paid in December 2018 in respect 
of your PPN, should be made available immediately to the PPN. 
Continuing the partnership funding model in place for the funding of PPNs, the 
Department has, as you are aware, requested authorities to provide an additional 
financial contribution of €5,000 in 2019 towards the engagement of a Support 
Worker. This combined potential additional funding of €30,700, inclusive of all 
associated Employer costs will provide a significant boost to the operation of PPNs.
PPN Representative Expenses
In relation to the payment of PPN representative expenses, the Department wishes 
to remind local authorities and PPNs that the costs incurred by PPN representatives 
participating on local authority boards and committees is to be met by the local 
authority – these costs are not to be met from the core funding of €80,000 available 
to the PPN from the Department/local authority
Inequality in society causes lots of problems which affects everyone. Nowadays we
know that the key driver of crime for instance, is not poverty, but inequality. The
bigger the cleavage between the rich and the poor in this country, the more
wealthy people have to hide between walls and spend more and more money on
private security. The higher the inequality, the more difficult it is to achieve social
cohesion due to the fact that in unequal societies rich and poor tend to be spatially
segregated. Another example is schooling, transport or the health sector. In
economic unequal societies like South Africa or in many Latin American countries
the upper and the middle class can afford private schools for their children, a car or
a private health insurance, while the poor have to rely on poor public services. On
the contrary, societies with high levels of equality provide better public services so
the rich and the poor equally benefit from them.
I think most people agree that inequality affects everyone negatively and that the
government has to do lots of efforts in order to counterbalance it. A common recipe
is redistributive policies. Especially the political left is pursuing this kind of policy,
which to a certain extent can have a positive effect. Nevertheless it always depends
on the degree of redistribution. The South African tax system already imposes a
great burden on the middle and upper class. I rather would state that the best way
to focus on equality is on social empowerment of the poor. Particularly education
plays a significant role – may it be primary, secondary or tertiary e

Dear Director Rodriguez:
On behalf of the Center for Non-Profits, a 501(c)(3) umbrella organization serving New Jersey’s
charities through advocacy, education, management and compliance assistance and other services, I
thank you for the opportunity to submit comments in response to the above-referenced proposal. PRN
2018-125 would require organizations registered with the Division of Consumer Affairs, Charities
Registration Section, to annually provide to the Division a list of contributors of cash or property
totaling $5,000 or more, if the organization does not already provide such information to the IRS as part
of its Form 990 filing in Schedule B.
The Center has a long history of working cooperatively with the Legislature, the Division of Consumer
Affairs and the Executive Branch to promote policies that will protect donors, charities and the public
while minimizing the administrative burdens of compliance with the law. We offer our comments in the
spirit of continuing this open, constructive communication.
It is our understanding that this rule is intended to counter the IRS’ July 2018 announcement (Rev. Proc.
2018-38) that, beginning with returns for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2018, non501(c)(3) organizations will no longer be required to disclose their donors in their Form 990 filings to
the IRS. The Division’s stated intent is to maintain the donor disclosure requirements for any entity to
whom they applied prior to the IRS’ action. While we can appreciate the intention behind this proposal,
we believe that in current form it goes beyond merely restoring the previous requirements. It could
prove confusing and burdensome for covered organizations, and could inadvertently impose new and
onerous requirements for some 501(c)(3) organizations which have not previously been required to
provide any such information to the IRS. Our questions and concerns follow.
The Division’s proposal could cause unintended problems for non-profit organizations,
including some which have heretofore not been subject to the disclosure requirements.
As you know, federal regulations permit most exempt organizations whose gross receipts are normally
$50,000 or less to file the Form 990-N e-Postcard rather than a full Form 990 or 990-EZ. The epostcard is a greatly simplified filing that requires only eight items of basic information and has never
required the submission of contributor information. Under PRN 2018-125, proposed N.J.A.C. 13:48-
4.3(a)(9) and N.J.A.C. 13:48-5.3(b)(5) would require filers that did not file Form 990 Schedule B to
essentially recreate the Schedule B information in a new filing with the Division. Unfortunately, because
the Division’s proposal makes no allowances for the size of the non-profit, any organization that is
eligible to file the IRS Form 990-N would now be required to submit extra information to the Division
that has not previously been needed, thereby undermining the intent of the e-Postcard
----S7KSXrq7;tc3e5U----PiO2cdC5;1n0mtW
----trn6NDSQ;h5dXNK----E3oSsR8Z;f2mcep
However, this overly broad and imprecise “charity” label has become increasingly confusing over time,
and can be especially problematic in the context of this regulatory proposal. While the Division may
have a public interest in regulating the solicitation activities of a wide array of entities, there are crucial
differences between 501(c)(3) organizations and the civic leagues, fraternal organizations, social welfare
organizations and others also covered by the Charitable Registration and Investigation Act. Using the
word “charity” interchangeably with an organization that is not tax-exempt under IRC Section 501(c)(3)
perpetuates misunderstanding by regulated entities, policy makers, media and the public. The Division’s
intended focus may be those entities that are newly exempt from the federal filing, but the liberal use of
the word “charity” may cause 501(c)(3) organizations to mistakenly believe that they must now comply
with a new filing requirement, or to submit their donor information in a new, duplicative format.
When the Charitable Registration and Investigation Act is re-examined in the future, we plan to
recommend that the terminology be updated in a more precise manner in order to address these
broader concerns. In the meantime, to facilitate compliance and clarity of interpretation and to foster a
more accurate understanding of the non-profit universe and 501(c)(3) subset, we urge the Division to
3
revise these regulations to reserve the specific term “charity” or “charitable organization” for actual
501(c)(3) organizations, and instead utilize a term such as “regulated organization,” “registrant
organization,” “covered organization” or similar phrase to refer to the broad array of groups covered by
the Division’s regulations.
While the Center for Non-Profits focuses primarily on issues and concerns related to 501(c)(3)
organizations, our review of the proposed regulation gave rise to other questions, including but not
limited to the following:
• What does the Division do with the donor information it already receives, and how will it use the
information provided under this proposal? Will the information be retained internally or shared
with other state departments or agencies, and under what circumstances will it be shared?
• What steps are, and will be, taken to protect the information from hacking or other security
breaches?
• To what extent is this information subject to, or exempt from, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
or Open Public Records Act (OPRA) inquiries?
• Does this proposal conflict with other portions of New Jersey statute regarding donor disclosure by
non-profit entities, particularly non-(c)(3) organizations? As an example, since New Jersey statute
does not require independent groups to disclose their donors to the Election Law Enforcement
Commission except under specific conditions, it’s unclear whether the Division could by regulation
require such a disclosure to an organization that falls under the broad definition of “charity” in the
Charitable Registration and Investigation Act

Dear PFCCS Course Consultant:
The Society of Critical Care Medicine appreciates all of your efforts and time on behalf of the Pediatric
Fundamental Critical Care Support (PFCCS) program.
As the PFCCS Course Consultant, please indicate that you have reviewed and determined that this
applicant has the met the requirements for the role of PFCCS Course Director. You have determined this
individual should be permitted to act as a Course Director without supervision. Course Director
requirements / criteria that must be met require that the candidate has:
 Been an SCCM-approved PFCCS Instructor in good standing
 Served as Course Director with mentorship of a PFCCS Consultant for at least one approved

 Assured that the PFCCS Course is consistently taught with goals, objectives, and vision of SCCM
 Demonstrated independently the Course Director roles and functions (eg, is present and available
