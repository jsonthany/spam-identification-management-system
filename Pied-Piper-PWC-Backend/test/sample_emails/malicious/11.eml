 Dear Reader,<br><br>
 The arrow in the image below shows where the cryptocurrency market is at this time&hellip;<br><br><img border="0"  alt="" style="-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic; border: 0; height: auto; line-height: 100%; outline: none; text-decoration: none;"><br><br>
 Right on the cusp of mass acceptance by mainstream users.<br><br>
 But two unrelated events are about to make select cryptos household names&hellip; and&hellip; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3rb8fpke/c22447aKKEs51557265vwDQ1564661MeT2619lVgp1285" style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><strong>shower investors with untold fortunes</strong></a>.<br><br>
 Due to these events more people will flock to cryptocurrencies than ever before and leave fiat money (like the dollar) in the dust.<br><br>
 In fact, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3rb8fpke/c22447aKKEs51557265vwDQ1564661MeT2619lVgp1285" is="" already="" in="" the="" action="" style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"></a>.<br><br><em>Business Insider</em> says, "As many as 36% of institutional investors in the US and Europe own crypto assets."<br><br>
 Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, says there is now "greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class."<br><br>
 And the new surge in demand along with diminishing supplies is about to send select coins to record highs.<br><br><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3rb8fpke/c22447aKKEs51557265vwDQ1564661MeT2619lVgp1285" style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><strong>Click here to read this developing story...</strong></a><br><br>
 Good luck and God bless!<br><br><br>

 P.S. By the way&hellip; certain coins are likely to explode higher in value than others. I'll show you how to get my list of top cryptocurrencies to buy and WHEN to buy them. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3rb8fpke/c22447aKKEs51557265vwDQ1564661MeT2619lVgp1285" style="-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><strong>All the details are right here.</strong></a>
