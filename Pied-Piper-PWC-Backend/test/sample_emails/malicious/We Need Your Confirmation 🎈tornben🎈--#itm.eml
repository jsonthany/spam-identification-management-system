    WELCOME TO MORNING MEDIA: Rebecca Morin will be filling in for me on Wednesday's newsletter, so drop her tips at rmorin@politico.com. Daniel Lippman (dlippman@politico.com/ @dlippman) contributed to the newsletter. Subscribe. Archives.

    PEN AMERICA IS OUT TODAY with a new report: "Truth on the Ballot: Fraudulent News, the Midterms Elections, and Prospects for 2020." The 50-page report addresses steps taken to combat the spread of fraudulent news following the 2016 election, assesses what happened in 2018 and offers recommendations ahead of the next presidential election. 

    ***************************

    JUST AS SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS reached 42 days without an on-camera press briefing, a new record for the Trump red House, she returned to the briefing room Monday to take questions - even if not always directly answering them. 

    - Sanders deflected several questions about President Donald Trump reportedly telling donors that "Democrats hate Jewish people." And she responded to a question about toning down heated rhetoric by accusing Democrats of being "comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother's womb, or killing a baby after birth."
